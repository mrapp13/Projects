My name is Michael Rapposelli.  I graduated from the University of Delaware with a degree in business economics and since then I have been in retail management for the last 6 years.
My career goals are to develop and grow in the field that has become my passion which is int eh fintech, blockchain and crypto industry. 
I chose fintech as my field because over the lasy year I realzied that this industry is where my passion lied.  I spend a majority of my free time that is not at the gym researching and learning  as much as possible about fintech.
